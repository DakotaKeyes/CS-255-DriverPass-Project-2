### Briefly summarizes the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, DriverPass, wanted to capitalize on a void in the marketplace, helping students train to pass their driving test. The owner of DriverPass had a list of requirements & functions that he expected from the new system. Some key front-end components were online classes, practice tests, a progress feature showing progress parameters, and on-the-road training with a scheduling feature to modify and cancel reservations and purchase & customize training packages. A few backend features included an option to download reports remotely, track information, securely store the customer info, an automated password reset feature, and a feature to update data and disable training packages. In addition, the system should operate on different environments and platforms- a website and mobile application- and they wanted the system to run on the cloud. Overall, the system had quite a few features but was not highly complex compared to other modern business systems. 

### What did you do particularly well?

Overall, I did well on this project, particularly with the UML diagrams. I have little experience with diagramming, so I researched and learned about each diagram's different symbols and components and examined excellent and inadequate examples. For example, my Use Case and Class diagram were done well. However, I need more experience to base it on my research and explore good diagrams and things to avoid in UML. 


### What would you pick if you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise? How would you improve it?

If I could revise some of my work, I would have selected a different use case than the "login feature." I chose that feature because some other use cases were more complex, and I needed help figuring out how to create it. However, I would like to go back and select a more challenging use case than login, which is a reasonably basic use case. I could have challenged myself more by choosing a more complex feature to the diagram, but I still did well on the diagram. 


### How did you interpret and implement the user's needs into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?
Understanding and effectively implementing the user's needs is a fundamental aspect of the SDLC. Since this was a mock interview, I could not ask any questions. However, I was able to read through the text interview and got a good idea of the company, the client, and the context in which the system would be used. Determining the requirements and listing the functional and non-functional requirements helped visualize the system's specifications. Furthermore, the interview document was clear and concise. DriverPass knew exactly what features it expected from the system, making it easy to understand the expectations before designing or planning anything. The user's needs are the most critical aspect of producing a high-quality system for the client. The user's needs are the system's foundation and must be noticed and developed. When developing a system such as the DriverPass system, the program operates and controls fundamental aspects of the company and needs to align with the business process and requirements that the client expects. Customer satisfaction and quality work align with adhering to the user's needs.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and create a system?

I approached this project differently than I have in the past. As I gain more experience coding, I have learned the importance of proper planning and design. Normally, I would spend some time researching, planning, and designing, and sometimes begin coding without a thorough understanding of the requirements or how I was going to implement all the requirements. However, in this project, I spent much more time researching, reading through the transcript repeatedly, and taking notes as I read. I also made a list of functional and non-functional requirements while reading and writing essential information. This documentation helped ensure I would meet the requirements, and I wasn't having to guess or hope I had remembered everything. Making a list of the requirements (functional & non-functional) makes it much easier to determine if the components are all present. I spent more time in the planning and design phase than usual, but the better planning & design, the easier the implementation will be (which is the most extended phase of the SDLC).
